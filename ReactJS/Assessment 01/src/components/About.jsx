      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an IT engineering student with a strong passion for building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in frontend development using React and Vite, and I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Python. I enjoy creating clean UI designs and reusable components that provide a smooth user experience across all devices.

Along with frontend development, I am actively preparing for a future career in AI and Cloud Engineering. I continuously work on improving my technical skills through projects and hands-on practice. I believe in learning by building real-world applications and staying updated with new technologies to grow as a confident and skilled software engineer.
